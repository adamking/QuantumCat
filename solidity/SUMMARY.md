## 🌐 Recommended Networks

### Primary: Base 🔵
- ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **Lowest fees in the industry**
- ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **2-second block times**
- ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **Coinbase ecosystem (100M+ users)**
- ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **Thriving memecoin community**
- **Cost:** ~$0.005-0.01 per transaction
- **DEXs:** Uniswap V3, Aerodrome (native), growing ecosystem
- **Verdict:** **This is why we built QuantumCat!**

### Why Not Other Networks?

#### ❌ Ethereum Mainnet
- **Cost:** $20-50 per transaction (1000-5000x more than Base)
- **Verdict:** Makes gameplay completely unaffordable
- **Use Case:** None - too expensive for memecoins

#### ⚠️ Arbitrum
- **Cost:** $0.05-0.10 per transaction (5-10x more than Base)
- **Verdict:** Workable but significantly more expensive
- **Trade-off:** Users will prefer Base's lower fees

#### ⚠️ Optimism
- **Cost:** $0.05-0.10 per transaction (5-10x more than Base)
- **Verdict:** Workable but significantly more expensive
- **Trade-off:** Users will prefer Base's lower fees

#### ⚠️ Polygon
- **Cost:** $0.02-0.05 per transaction (2-5x more than Base)
- **Verdict:** Better than Ethereum but still pricier than Base
- **Trade-off:** Less memecoin ecosystem adoption

**Conclusion: Base is the only network that makes QuantumCat's gameplay mechanics economically viable and fun!**

## 🛠️ Quick Start Deployment

### 1. Pre-Deployment
```bash
cd /Users/adamking/dev/QuantumCat/solidity
npm test                    # Verify all tests pass
REPORT_GAS=true npm test    # Check gas costs
npx hardhat compile         # Compile contracts
```

### 2. Testnet Deployment (Base Sepolia) 🧪
```bash
npm run deploy:base-sepolia
```

### 3. Verify on Basescan
```bash
npm run verify
```

### 4. Mainnet Deployment (Base) 🔵 RECOMMENDED
```bash
npm run deploy:base
npm run verify
```

### Why Base is the Only Viable Network:

| Network | Cost Per Transaction | Monthly Cost (100 plays) | Viability |
|---------|---------------------|-------------------------|-----------|
| **Base** 🔵 | **$0.005-0.01** | **$0.50-1.00** | ✅ **Perfect** |
| Arbitrum | $0.05-0.10 | $5-10 | ⚠️ 5-10x more |
| Optimism | $0.05-0.10 | $5-10 | ⚠️ 5-10x more |
| Ethereum | $20-50 | $2,000-5,000 | ❌ Unaffordable |

**Base makes QuantumCat gameplay viable. Other networks are too expensive!**
