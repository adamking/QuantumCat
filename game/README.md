# Schr√∂dinger's Box Arcade üéÆ

A simple 8-bit style game for interacting with the QuantumCat ERC20 token system.

## Features

- **8-bit Sealed Boxes**: Click on cardboard sealed boxes with locks and tape
- **Mini-Game**: Play a quick catch-the-particles game before unboxing
- **Unbox Mechanic**: Break the seal to convert QCAT tokens into either all ALIVECAT or all DEADCAT (50/50 random)
- **Reseal Mechanic**: Combine equal pairs of ALIVECAT + DEADCAT back into QCAT
- **Wallet Integration**: Connect with MetaMask to interact with real tokens
- **8-bit Retro Style**: Pixel art graphics with authentic cardboard box rendering

## How to Play

    DEADCAT: '0xYourDEADCATAddress',
    CONTROLLER: '0xYourControllerAddress'
};
```
