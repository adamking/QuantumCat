# Quantum Cats 🐱⚛️

A three-token memecoin experiment in quantum superposition - **deployed on Base** 🔵 for ultra-low fees!

## 🎯 Features

- **Three-Token System**: ERC-20 architecture with QCAT, ALIVECAT, and DEADCAT tokens on Base L2
- **Observe & Rebox Mechanics**: 
  - Observe QCAT to collapse it into ALIVECAT OR DEADCAT (50/50, 5-block commit-reveal)
  - Rebox pairs of ALIVE + DEAD back into QCAT (with 4% deflationary fee)
- **Arbitrage Triangle**: Natural price balance through QCAT ↔ ALIVE ↔ DEAD trading
- **Quantum Superposition Animation**: Interactive cat that switches between alive and dead states
- **Epic Glitch Effects**: Mind-bending visual quantum state transitions
- **Complete Landing Page**: 
  - Full three-token tokenomics breakdown
  - Observe/rebox mechanics explained
  - Base L2 advantages highlighted
  - Uniswap v3 + Aerodrome pool info
  - Step-by-step buying & playing guide
  - Comprehensive FAQ and disclaimer

## 🔵 Why Base?

This project is **built exclusively for Base**, Coinbase's Ethereum L2:

- **🚀 Ultra-Low Fees**: $0.005-0.01 per transaction (vs $20-50 on Ethereum)
- **⚡ Fast**: 2-second block times for instant confirmations
- **🏦 Easy Onboarding**: Coinbase's 100M+ users have seamless access
- **🌊 Growing Ecosystem**: Uniswap, Aerodrome, and thriving memecoin culture
- **💙 Perfect for Gameplay**: Affordable costs make observe/rebox mechanics viable

**Base makes QuantumCat possible. Ethereum would be too expensive to play!**

## 💻 Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

## 📦 Technology Stack

- **React** - UI framework
- **TypeScript** - Type safety
- **Vite** - Build tool & dev server
- **Tailwind CSS** - Styling
- **Shadcn/ui** - UI components

## 🎨 How It Works

### The Animation
The cat exists in quantum superposition, randomly collapsing to alive or dead states when clicked. Each state transition features:
- Dynamic glitch animation with randomized visual effects
- Procedurally generated quantum collapse sound effects
- Smooth state transitions with flicker effects
- Text scrambling during state changes

### The Tokenomics
Three separate ERC-20 tokens:
- **QCAT**: The superposed coin - starts at 662,607,015 supply
- **ALIVECAT**: Observed outcome from collapsing QCAT
- **DEADCAT**: Observed outcome from collapsing QCAT

**Observe**: Burn QCAT → Get ALIVECAT OR DEADCAT (binary outcome equals QCAT burned)
 - Requires commit-reveal with 5-block delay for high-entropy RNG
 - No supply change, just state transformation

**Rebox**: Burn ALIVECAT + DEADCAT pairs → Get QCAT
 - 4% fee creates deflationary sink
 - Burns 2 tokens, mints ~1.92 QCAT

**Price Relationship**: P_QCAT ≈ (P_ALIVE + P_DEAD) / 1.92
- Arbitrage opportunities keep markets balanced

## 💰 Tokenomics

- **Total Supply**: 662,607,015 QCAT (inspired by Planck's constant)
- **Network**: Base L2 (Coinbase's Ethereum L2) 🔵
- **Tax**: 0% (no buy/sell tax on any of the three tokens)
- **Distribution**: 
  - 60% Liquidity Pools (397M) - Uniswap + Aerodrome on Base
  - 20% Community Rewards (133M) - Liquidity mining, airdrops
  - 10% Team (66M) - 12-month linear vesting
  - 10% Strategic Reserve (66M) - CEX listings, partnerships
- **Chain**: Base (Ethereum L2 by Coinbase)
- **DEXs**: Uniswap V3 + Aerodrome on Base

### Why Base for Trading?

✅ **$0.005-0.01 per trade** vs $20-50 on Ethereum  
✅ **Instant swaps** with 2-second blocks  
✅ **Easy onboarding** via Coinbase Wallet  
✅ **Best DEXs**: Uniswap V3 + Aerodrome with deep liquidity

## 🔒 Security Features

✅ Deployed on Base L2 (Ethereum-secured rollup)  
✅ Immutable contracts (no admin control)  
✅ Zero Buy/Sell Tax on all three tokens  
✅ Fair RNG with 5-block commit-reveal  
✅ Full ERC-20 compliance  
✅ Comprehensive test coverage

## 🛒 How to Buy

1. **Get a Web3 wallet** - Download [Coinbase Wallet](https://www.coinbase.com/wallet) or MetaMask
2. **Switch to Base network** - Add Base L2 network to your wallet (automatic in Coinbase Wallet)
3. **Get ETH on Base** - Bridge ETH from Ethereum via [Base Bridge](https://bridge.base.org/) or buy directly on Coinbase
4. **Swap for $QCAT** - Visit [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/) or [Aerodrome](https://aerodrome.finance/), connect wallet, swap ETH for QCAT
5. **HODL in quantum superposition!** 🐱⚛️

### Quick Start with Coinbase:
- Easiest path: Buy ETH on Coinbase → Send to Coinbase Wallet on Base → Swap on Uniswap
- No bridging needed if you use Coinbase ecosystem!

## 📝 Deployment

The app automatically deploys to GitHub Pages when you push to main. See [DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md) for other hosting options.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

$QCAT, $ALIVECAT, and $DEADCAT are memecoins created for entertainment purposes only. They have no intrinsic value, no utility, and no expectation of financial return or profit. These tokens are deployed on Base L2 as ERC-20 tokens for affordable gameplay. Cryptocurrency markets are extremely volatile and speculative. Never purchase more tokens than you can afford to lose completely. This is not financial advice.

Just like Schrödinger's cat, your investment may exist in multiple states simultaneously. Observing your wallet may collapse the wave function. **Trading costs ~$0.01 on Base vs $20-50 on Ethereum - Base makes the gameplay possible!** Past performance is not indicative of future results.
